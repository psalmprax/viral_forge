# ettametta: The Autonomous Social Engine

ettametta is the world's first fully autonomous, multimodal AI engine designed for solo creators to build and scale content empires with professional-grade intuition.

## Core Pillars of the Ecosystem

### 👁️ The Visual Cortex (VLM Intuition)
ettametta doesn't just "read"—it "watches." By integrating **Vision-Language Models (Gemini 1.5 Flash)**, the engine performs keyframe analysis to intuit mood, lighting, and aesthetic quality, ensuring every creative decision is visually grounded.
- **Dynamic Grading**: Captions and filters are selected based on the visual mood of the scene.
- **Semantic Trimming**: AI-driven "hook" detection keeps only high-energy segments.

### 🕸️ Nexus V2 (Graph-Based Orchestration)
The **Nexus Pipeline** allows creators to visually compose complex content workflows.
- **Visual Graph**: Use [React Flow](file:///home/psalmprax/ettametta/apps/dashboard/src/app/nexus/page.tsx) to drag-and-drop nodes for Discovery, Synthesis, Transformation, and Publishing.
- **Blueprints**: Save and reuse successful pipeline templates to scale production instantly across different niches.

### 🦅 OpenClaw (White-Labeled Agent Network)
Every creator gets a dedicated, private AI agent.
- **Multi-Bot Manager**: Connect your own private bot via @BotFather. ettametta orchestrates concurrent bot lifecycles for every user.
- **Autonomous Control**: Command your entire engine via Telegram—trigger scans, approve videos, and monitor metrics from anywhere.

### 🎨 Generative Dreamscapes
Beyond transformation, ettametta is a **Synthesis Engine**.
- **Dual-Engine Support**: Integration with Google Veo 3 and high-performance open-source models (Wan2.2, LTX-2).
- **Scene Orchestration**: Intelligent narrative expansion for multi-scene generative videos with perfectly synced voiceovers.

## Technical Milestones

- **Phase 1-15**: Established the core Python/Go infrastructure and Security Sentinel.
- **Phase 16-20**: Migrated to multimodal VLM intuition and established the Visual Cortex.
- **Phase 21-25**: Launched Nexus V2 (Graph Pipelines) and Storytelling Synthesis.
- **Phase 36-41**: Expansion into WhatsApp, Persona-based content, Skool discovery, and Dashoard monetization settings.
- **Phase 42-44**: Infrastructure Hardening & Final Rebrand. Dockerized Jenkins, automated YouTube bot bypass, and standardized **ettametta** branding across UI and authentication tokens.

## 🎨 Branding & Performance Resilience

ettametta is now a unified, production-hardened environment:
- **Global Rebrand**: Full migration from legacy ViralForge to **ettametta**. All UI headers and authentication token keys (`et_token`) are standardized.
- **Downloader Resiliency**: `yt-dlp` integration is optimized with broad format fallbacks to support YouTube Shorts and authenticated cookie synchronization for bot bypass.
- **Dockerized Jenkins**: No more manual setup; all CI/CD logic is containerized for portability.
- **JCasC (Configuration as Code)**: Credentials and system settings are managed via YAML for secret-safe, repeatable deployments.
- **Optimized Networking**: Stale Docker bridges and duplicate networks have been pruned for seamless service-to-service communication.

## 🏆 Market Advantage
ettametta isn't just a "clipper"; it's a **Director**. It proactive discovers trends across 15+ platforms, intuits aesthetics that transcript-only tools miss, and gives you 100% private ownership on OCI ARM infrastructure.
