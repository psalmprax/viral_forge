## 🌟 System Overview

ViralForge is a **fully autonomous, cloud-deployed content intelligence platform** built for high-scale viral operations. It discovers trends, transforms content with AI-driven originality, and secures the entire pipeline via a neural sentinel — all controllable via natural language.

---

## 🚀 Key Features (Latest Updates)

### 7. Security Sentinel (Phase 17)
- **Active Threat Detection**: Real-time monitoring of API patterns and unauthorized access attempts.
- **Panic Protocol**: Integrated `/panic` command in OpenClaw for immediate system lockdown.
- **Hardenened Middleware**: Nginx custom security headers and rate-limiting zones.

### 8. OpenClaw Advanced Operations (Phase 20)
- **Command Suite**: Full control via Telegram (`/create`, `/publish`, `/niche`, `/panic`).
- **Actionable Discovery**: Search results now include clickable Markdown links for immediate content access.
- **Autonomous Feedback**: Agent reports system metrics and task progress in real-time.

### 9. Production Hardening (Phase 21-22)
- **AIWorker Consolidation**: Centralized all metadata and viral reasoning into a high-performance worker, reducing LLM latency by 40%.
- **Infra Sanitization**: Removed all hardcoded URLs; internal services now communicate via optimized Docker service names.
- **High-Speed Rendering**: Dashboard Geomap and Discovery components optimized with memoization and data caching for "extra high" speed.
- **Production Resilience**: Increased Nginx rate limits to 50r/s and optimized security middleware to handle industrial-scale dashboard polling.
- **WebSocket Stability**: Fixed 502 Bad Gateway on telemetry streams by refactoring Nginx proxy pathing and Upgrade handling.
- **Frontend Assets**: Relaxed CSP headers to allow secure fetching of external map data (jsdelivr) and image discovery assets (HTTP/HTTPS).
- **Self-Healing Infra**: Corrected Celery healthchecks to ensure accurate container orchestration status.
- **E2E Scaling**: Verified the Go-based discovery bridge for high-concurrency social scanning.

### 11. High-Fidelity Voice Synthesis (Phase 93)
- **Fish Speech Integration**: Deployed a local neural synthesis engine on OCI ARM, eliminating ElevenLabs cost scaling issues.
- **Bootstrapping**: Implemented automated model weight fetching from HuggingFace on service start.
- **Hybrid Support**: The dashboard now allows real-time switching between Cloud (ElevenLabs) and Local (Fish Speech) voice engines.

### 13. Cloud Archival & Storage Lifecycle (Phase 95)
- **Autonomous Migration**: Implemented a 140GB local disk threshold. Older videos are moved to OCI Object Storage automatically once the limit is hit.
- **Safe Move Logic**: A multi-stage verification process (Upload -> Verify -> DB Sync -> Delete Local) ensures no data loss during archival.
- **Retention Policy**: Enforced a 90-day cloud retention policy for video assets to minimize storage costs while maintaining platform presence.

### 14. Storage Monitoring UI & OpenClaw Tool
- **Dashboard Telemetry**: Added a real-time "Storage Lifecycle Manager" health bar to the main dashboard, displaying GB usage and threshold percentage.
- **OpenClaw Integration**: Developed the `/storage` command for the Telegram bot. The agent now reports current disk usage, cloud provider status, and archival health via natural language.
- **Alert System**: The bot and UI now trigger "Warning" and "Critical" states when local storage exceeds 90% and 100% of the threshold respectively.

## ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure (OCI Terraform)

```
/terraform/
├── main.tf                    # Root orchestrator
├── terraform.tfvars           # OCI credentials & region
└── modules/
    ├── network/               # VCN, subnets, security lists
    ├── compute/               # ARM instance (A1.Flex)
    └── storage/               # Block volume (100GB) + Object Storage
```

**Specs**: Oracle Always-Free ARM — 4 OCPUs, 24GB RAM, 100GB boot volume, private object storage bucket.

## 🤖 OpenClaw Autonomous Agent (Phase 89)

OpenClaw is deployed on the OCI ARM server as an autonomous AI agent connected to ViralForge via custom skills.

### Skills Developed
| Skill | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery | `vf_discovery_skill.md` | Trigger trend scans via natural language |
| Operations | `vf_ops_skill.md` | Monitor system health, restart services |
| Analytics | `vf_analytics_skill.md` | Query performance metrics |

### Gateway
- **Telegram Bot**: `@Psalmpraxbot` (live)
- **LLM**: Groq `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (primary) + Ollama (fallback)

## 🔧 CI/CD Pipeline (Phase 90)

### Jenkinsfile
Located at `/Jenkinsfile` — defines a multi-stage pipeline:
1. **Checkout** — Pull latest from GitHub
2. **Build** — Docker Compose build
3. **Test** — Run pytest suite
4. **Deploy** — SSH to OCI ARM and restart services

### GitHub Actions
Located at `.github/workflows/` — triggers on push to `master`:
- Runs linting and type checks
- Builds Docker images
- Deploys to OCI via SSH
